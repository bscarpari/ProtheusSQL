## Description
The tool aims to assist the user in learning and practicing SQL commands in an interactive way.

It allows the user to execute **SQL queries** on a fictional database and see the results of these queries in real-time. Additionally, the tool offers features such as a **Dashboard**, **Calendar** and Forum so that the user can test, monitor, and share their knowledge to efficiently solidify it.

To ensure that the user has a complete learning experience, the tool also includes help and reference resources, such as an SQL syntax guide and a list of common functions that are displayed in the command execution location.
